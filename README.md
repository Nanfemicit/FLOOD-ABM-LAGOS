# project-alpha
Real time climate hazard tracker

Hi, I’m Ruth! This is my first real-time data project at the intersection of climate risk, sustainability, and databases.

Right now, I’m building this project from scratch, learning and documenting every step as I go.

More about the “why” and my journey will be added here when I complete the first version. For now — welcome to the beginning of project Alpha!
