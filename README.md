Agent-based model for understanding how rainfall, land cover, and drainage capacity shape urban flooding in Lagos, Nigeria.

Every year it rains in Lagos and the impacts are disastrous. Streets flood, homes are submerged, and life pauses.
We often aatribute it to climate change, but what about planning failures, governance gaps, and design decisions that make the city more vulnerable?

In this project, an agent-based model (ABM) built with Python will be used to see how rainfall, surface cover, and land use  interact to influence flooding patterns across Lagos.

This is my first environmental systems project using ABM to connect climate processes with urban decision-making.
I am building it from scratch, learning and documenting each step from translating hydrologic ideas into code to visualising how small changes might reduce flood risk.

More about the “why” and insights from the simulations will be added once the first version is complete.
For now, welcome to the beginning of the Flood Learning ABM.
